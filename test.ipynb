"## Prerequisites ",
" ",
"1. **Jupyter Notebook** &ndash; If you're not already reading this document in Jupyter Notebook, I recommend it be installed by following the steps listed in the "Installing Jupyter using Anaconda" section of the "[Project Jupyter | Install](http://jupyter.org/install)" page. ",
" ",
" > ðŸ’¡***Note:*** When installing Anaconda on macOS, its installer may use the "install for all users of this computer" option by default. That installs Anaconda in a strange place, so it's recommended to explicitly specify the "install for the current user only" option. When I first looked at the options, the "current user" one appeared to be selected and an error message was also shown that the installation couldn't be completed. However, after I clicked the "current user" option, the error message was removed and the installation completed successfully. ",
" ",
"1. **Caliper** &ndash; Get "caliper-python" and install it in the Anaconda environment so it will be accessible by Jupyter Notebook: ",
" ",
" 1. Clone a copy of [IMSGlobal/caliper-python](https://github.com/IMSGlobal/caliper-python) from GitHub. (Those that aren't familiar with git may download caliper-php as a ZIP file instead. Expand the ZIP file before continuing to the next step.) ",
" ",
" 1. In the ***same directory*** where caliper-python was downloaded (i.e., do **not** enter that directory before continuing) enter the following commands at a shell prompt: ",
" ",
" 1. `source activate base` ",
" ",
" 1. `pip install -e caliper-python` ",
" ",
" 1. If Jupyter Notebook was already running as Caliper was installed, it may be necessary to stop Jupyter Notebook and start it again before continuing. ",
" ",
"After the prerequisites have been satisfied, you may download and run **[this notebook](https://gist.github.com/lsloan/a1e56e2c1f1f27200ac0b0c9b41ced3d)** in your own instance of Jupyter Notebook."
